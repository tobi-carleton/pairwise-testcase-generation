# Pairwise Testing Test Suite Generation Using In-Parameter-Order Algorithm

## SYSC 5807 Final Project

## Steps to run code
The project has a dependency on JFreeChart in order to do plotting. Recommended way of running the code is to clone the repository and use an IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse to build the code. Both IDEs come with Maven installed, which is able to read the pom.xml file and install required dependencies

The implementation code of the In-Parameter-Order algorithm and Java-based random greedy algorithm are in the package `src/main/java/org/tobi`
